# ExileApi private fork of PoeHud

  

Dirty copy of my private fork.
Difference with main fork:
* Read memory  like structs (better for CPU, but used more memory)
* New cache system
* New rendering with DX11
* Plugins can compile from source
* A lot diagnostic information for easy found performance problem
* No hooks mouse and keyboard for prevent lag when debug
* All "standart" plugins cut. (Now they should be like another plugins)
